# Anubis

An analog horror ARG built as a Next.js browser-riddle platform with hand-authored puzzle levels.

Players sign in, solve the current file, and unlock the next one in sequence. Levels live under `levels/lv-XXX` as hand-written `level.json`, `prompt.mdx`, and optional `assets/` files.

## Stack

- Next.js 16 app router
- React 19
- MongoDB for users, sessions, progress, and leaderboard data
- Local filesystem storage for profile images and GIF avatars
- Local level files served by the app
- Docker-ready production build

## Local Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:3000`.

Required `.env.local` values:

```ini
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<password>@<cluster>/<db>?retryWrites=true&w=majority
SESSION_SECRET=dev-session-secret
PWD_PEPPER=dev-pepper
UPLOAD_DIR=.data/uploads
```

## Scripts

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `npm run dev` | Start the local Next.js dev server. |
| `npm run build` | Create a production build. |
| `npm run start` | Start the production server after build. |
| `npm run lint` | Run ESLint. |
| `npm test` | Run Vitest. |

## Level Authoring

Each playable level is manually maintained:

```text
levels/lv-001/
  level.json
  prompt.mdx
  assets/
    manifest.md
```

Keep committed puzzle walkthroughs in `walkthroughs/lv-XXX.md` so repository readers can audit the intended solve path.

When credentials change, update the hashes in `level.json`. Do not put plain final credential pairs in manifests or live prompts.

## Production Build

The app can run as a standard Next.js server or as the provided Docker service.
Create a production env file from the example, then build the container:

```bash
cp deploy/.env.example deploy/.env
nano deploy/.env
docker compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

The Docker service expects an external network named `web` and stores uploaded
profile images in the mounted `uploads/` directory.
